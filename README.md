# Weapons Cleaning
The mod adds a system of condition of your weapon. Now if you use any weapon for a long time, its damage will decrease. To restore the damage of the weapon, it must be cleaned. To clean your weapon, you will need a Gun Cleaning Kit, which can be purchased at any Ammu-Nation.

You can see the current status of your weapon in the weapon selector in the lower right corner.

# Controls
Open the weapon selection wheel, select the weapon you want to clean and hold down the X key.

# Installation
1. Download ScriptHookV
2. Download ScriptHookVDotNet
3. Download LemonUI
3. Move all files from the archive to the scripts folder (if it does not exist, create it).
